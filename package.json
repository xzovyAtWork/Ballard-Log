PowerShell is persistent on exiting and restarting the computer. From now on open powershell as admin hit the up arrow on your keyboard and it will cycle through your past commands. Neat!\r b.\tIf you want to change your ip address, hit the up arrow and replace the ip address from 169.254.1.2 to whatever you like. \r 3)\tGo through the usual procedure at 169.254.1.1\r 4)\tChange ip address to 192.168.168.128 from powershell. You only need manually change this once, from then on just cycle up with the up arrow key and you’ll see your previous entries. \r 5)\tWith webCTRL server running, open your browser of choice.
